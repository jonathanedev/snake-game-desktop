# snake-game-desktop
This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game snake using Java.


## How to play?
Using the WASD or arrow keys, you can control the snake and use it to eat the apples in the grid.
<br />The grid size is adjustable by using the menu dropdown.
<br />The top 5 highest scores can be viewed in the scoreboard held in the dropdown menu.


## Compilation script
Please note the compilation script is still buggy and may not work in trying to create a .jar file.
<br />The script accepts 2 possible arguments:

- `clean`: perform a clean build of the project.
- `package`: create a `.jar` file from the project sources.

For example,
```bash
./compile.sh package clean
```
